            Name: Inoceramus goldfussianus<br>
            Formation: Kulakkalnattam Formation<br>
            Locality: West of Kulakkalnattam    <br>     
            Classification: Molluscs: Bivalvis: Pteriida: Inoceramidae <p>
            <article>
                Inoceramus (Greek: translation "fibrous shell" for the fibrous structure of the mineral crystals in the shell)<br>
                is an extinct genus of fossil marine pteriomorphian bivalves that superficially resembled<br> the related winged 
                pearly oysters of the extant genus Pteria. <br> They lived from the Early Jurassic to latest Cretaceous.
  <p>

                Inoceramids had thick shells composed of "prisms" of calcite deposited perpendicular to the surface, <br>
                and unweathered fossils commonly preserve the mother-of-pearl luster the shells had in life.<br> 
                Most species have prominent growth lines which appear as raised semicircles concentric to the growing 
                edge of the shell.

                <p>
                Paleontologists suggest that the giant size of some species was an adaptation for life in the murky bottom waters, <br>
                with a correspondingly large gill area that would have allowed the animal to survive in oxygen-deficient waters.

                <p>
                Scientific Name: Inoceramus (genus) Inoceramids are bivalves related to living clams and mussels and are one of <br>
                the most common marine fossils of the Late Cretaceous. Large, diverse groups of Inoceramids lived in shallow waters<br>
                and were epifaunal, covering the muddy seafloor like a carpet.

                <p>
                Over 100 million years ago, long before the extinction of land-dwelling dinosaurs,<br> there lived a group of massive clams
                called Inoceramus.<br> With some species having shells up to 6.5 feet wide, they were "among the largest to have ever lived,"<br>
                according to experts. As a result, these giant bivalves produced "very large pearls."<br>
                At just over three-quarters of an inch in diameter, experts have now confirmed that a "very rare" and "most impressive" <br>
                fossil discovered in the Australian outback is the largest fossil pearl ever found in the country.

             <br> Inoceramids:  Giant clams of the Cretaceous<br>  

             <article>

                Inoceramids: Some species of clams (bivalves) grew to giant size in the late Cretaceous, attaining diameters of four feet or more. <br> 
                In cross section, these shells are composed of prismatic (calcitic) crystals. 
                <br>The inner, nacreous (Mother of Pearl) layer of the shell (composed of aragonite) was usually dissolved during fossilization and 
                <br>the outer portion is usually covered with colonies of oysters and other invertebrates.<br> 
                Pearls are occasionally found pressed into the Inoceramid shell. <br> 
                According to Sowerby 1823, Inoceramus means "fibrous shell," describing the prisms that are visible on the edge of shell fragments. 
                <br>Inoceramus cuvieri was the first species of Inoceramus that was formally described by Sowerby (1814). <br>
                Several species are found in the Late Cretaceous rocks of Kansas.<br>,<br>
