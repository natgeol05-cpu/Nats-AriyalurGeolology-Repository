            Name: Sphenoceramus<br>
            Formation: Karai Formation (Karai 'badlands') <br>
            Locality: Near Aiyanavaram.   <br>       
            Classification: Molluscs: Bivalvia: Order- Pteriida: Family - Inoceramidae: Genus - Sphenoceramus <p>

            <article>
                Sphenoceramus is a genus of extinct, gigantic inoceramid clams that lived during the Late Cretaceous period. 
                These fossils are characterized by a unique shell sculpture with concentric folds that can be intersected by oblique radial ribs.<br> 
                Sphenoceramus species, like the massive S. steenstrupi, have been found globally and are considered important index fossils <br>
                for dating specific geological strata. Some species may have survived in low-oxygen environments, potentially with the help of <br>
                symbiotic bacteria, and some fossils have been discovered near cold seeps. 


                <p>
                    Key characteristics and lifestyle
                •	Genus: Sphenoceramus is a genus within the extinct family Inoceramidae.<br>
                •	Time period: Lived during the Late Cretaceous period, with some fossils from the Santonian to Campanian stages.<br>
                •	Size: Known for being gigantic, with some species like S. steenstrupi reaching enormous sizes, up to 2 meters in height.<br>
                •	Shell structure: Characterized by concentric folds that are often intersected by oblique radial ribs.<br>
                •	Habitat: Found worldwide in marine sediments, suggesting wide dispersal and possibly long-lived larvae. <br>
                •	Some species were abundant in low-diversity or low-oxygen environments.<br>
                •	Symbiosis: Evidence suggests some species may have had chemosymbiotic bacteria in their gills, <br>
                •	which could have helped them survive in oxygen-depleted waters or near cold seeps. 

                <p>
                •	Index fossil: Due to its recognizable shell sculpture and distinct time range,<br> Sphenoceramus has been used 
                as an index fossil to help correlate rock layers globally.<br>
                •	Fossil associations: The presence of Sphenoceramus in certain strata can indicate<br> specific paleoenvironmental 
                conditions, such as the presence of cold seeps.<br>
                •	Geographic range: Fossils have been found in locations such as Japan, Russia, Canada, Greenland,<br> and the 
                United States, providing valuable data for understanding global geological history. 

                <p>
                The scientific classification for Sphenoceramus is: Kingdom: Animalia, Phylum: Mollusca, Class: Bivalvia, <br>
                Order: Pteriida, Family: Inoceramidae, and Genus: Sphenoceramus.<br> This classification places it within the V
                larger group of extinct inoceramid bivalves, which were related to modern clams and mussels.
